            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><strong>1.01 AGB, King’s Buildings, Thomas Bayes Rd, Edinburgh, UK</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Cell:</strong> +447404586610</p>

            <p>I have a track record of scientific research and innovations focused on multimodal systems, ambient
            assisted living technologies, affective computing and digital biomarkers for health monitoring. The innovation track record includes MoodBox, system-directed speech detection through speech and EEG, Speaker
            detection in the field of view of the camera/robot, a recommender system for videos (selected as the most
            innovative application of speech from Academia by SpeechTEK), Alzhimers’ dementia prediction system
            through speech and automatic cognitive health assessment. My research has resulted in the authorship of
            around 60 peer-reviewed research papers including publications in BMJ open, Lancet Regional Health Europe, Nature Scientific reports, Frontier in Ageing Neuroscience, IEEE-JSTSP, Speech Communication and
            Computer Speech and Language. I have presented my work in the top venues of speech and multimodal
            information processing such as INTERSPEECH, ICASSP, EMBC and ICMI. I have experience in managing research, having led work packages in research projects, and have been endorsed by TechNation UK as a
            recognized leader in digital technologies. I completed my PhD in Sep 2018 and the title of the thesis is “Improving Social Intelligence of Machines in the Context of Public Speaking Situations" under the supervision
            of Prof. Nick Campbell and Prof. Carl Vogel. Based on my track record of developing digital health technologies, particularly for Alzheimer’s Dementia, I believe that digital health technologies based on speech,
            video, and wearable sensors form my future research program and establish me as a global leader in that
            domain.</p>

                <h3>Natural immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection</h3>
                <p>SARS-CoV-2 infection provides protection against reinfection and severe COVID-19 disease; however, this protective effect may wane over time. We assessed the waning of natural immunity conferred by previous infection against severe disease and symptomatic reinfection in Brazil and Scotland. I coordinated the analysis and integrated the analysis results, and was jointly responsible for the analysis.</p>

            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <h3>Postdoctoral Research Associate (Feb 2023 — present)</h3>
            <p>School of Engineering, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom</p>
            <p>This Research Associate (RA) position contributes to the EPSRC New Horizons-funded project that aims
            to learn better representations by exploiting rare and unique data within the IDCOM institute at the University of Edinburgh, which is funded by EPSRC. I am undertaking research related to representation and
            shortcut learning, including memorisation in machine learning.</p>

            <h3>Postdoctoral Data Analyst (Oct 2022 — Sep 2023)</h3>
            <p>Usher Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom</p>
            <p>I am currently working with Sony on Employing AI to determine patients’ treatment goals and detect
            very early brain dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease. During this project, I have been seeking advice from IT
            services about security questions raised by NHS about the patients’ data for ethical approval. The findings
            have been published in AAIC 2023 as an abstract.</p>

            <h3>Postdoctoral Data Analyst (Jan 2022 — Sep 2022)</h3>
            <p>Usher Institute, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom</p>
            <p>I led the study about the potential waning of natural immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection from hospitalization and death outcomes in Scotland and Brazil (plan to submit soon). There were other two studies
            where I took part as a team member, i.e. vaccine effectiveness and the characteristics of never-infected people. One article was published in Lancet Regional Health Europe.</p>
