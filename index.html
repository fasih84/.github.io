            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have a track record of scientific research and innovations focused on multimodal systems, ambient assisted living technologies, affective computing and digital biomarkers for health monitoring. The innovation track record includes MoodBox, system-directed speech detection through speech and EEG, Speaker detection in the field of view of the camera/robot, a recommender system for videos (selected as the most innovative application of speech from Academia by SpeechTEK), Alzhimers’ dementia prediction system through speech and automatic cognitive health assessment.</p>
            <p>My research has resulted in the authorship of around 60 peer-reviewed research papers including publications in BMJ open, Lancet Regional Health Europe, Nature Scientific reports, Frontier in Ageing Neuroscience, IEEE-JSTSP, Speech Communication and Computer Speech and Language. I have presented my work in the top venues of speech and multimodal information processing such as INTERSPEECH, ICASSP, EMBC and ICMI. I have experience in managing research, having led work packages in research projects, and have been endorsed by TechNation UK as a recognized leader in digital technologies. I completed my PhD in Sep 2018 and the title of the thesis is “Improving Social Intelligence of Machines in the Context of Public Speaking Situations" under the supervision of Prof. Nick Campbell and Prof. Carl Vogel.</p>
            <p>Based on my track record of developing digital health technologies, particularly for Alzheimer’s Dementia, I believe that digital health technologies based on speech, video, and wearable sensors form my future research program and establish me as a global leader in that domain.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Alzheimer’s Dementia Prediction System</h3>
                <p>Development of a system for predicting Alzheimer’s dementia through speech analysis. The system leverages machine learning techniques to analyze cognitive health and detect early signs of dementia.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Speaker Detection in the Field of View of Camera/Robot</h3>
                <p>A novel approach to detecting active speakers within the field of view using visual prosody information, such as head and lip movements, to assist in human-robot interaction.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Natural immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection</h3>
                <p>SARS-CoV-2 infection provides protection against reinfection and severe COVID-19 disease; however, this protective effect may wane over time. We assessed the waning of natural immunity conferred by previous infection against severe disease and symptomatic reinfection in Brazil and Scotland. I coordinated the analysis and integrated the analysis results, and was jointly responsible for the analysis.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Blood and CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer’s recognition and progression</h3>
                <p>Machine-learning techniques were applied to human blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker data related to cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients available via Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Cognitive Impairment Detection</h3>
                <p>Development of methods and systems for monitoring cognitive health through spontaneous speech, with a focus on privacy protection through data anonymization pipelines using low-resource devices.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Volleyball Action Recognition</h3>
                <p>This work involves evaluating wearable sensors for volleyball action recognition. I co-led the data annotation and the development of an automatic volleyball action recognition system during a summer school project in collaboration with the University of Twente, Netherlands.</p>
